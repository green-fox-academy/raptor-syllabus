# Module Training Phase
The course consists of 3 distinct phases:-
- Basics - introducing the foundations of software development and studying HTML and CSS
- Java - learning the core concepts in programming (that can translate to other languages), and then expanding deeper into the facilities and opportunities afforded in the Java environment.
- Practical Application - applying the knowledge and skills learnt to a full deliverable.

## Module 01 -  Basics (Phase 1)
*What are the core elements of how software and computers operate and communicate to deliver and capture information.*

- Introduction
- Team building
- Command-line, GIT
- HTML, CSS
- Practice - "Create CV using HTML and CSS"

## Module 02 - Sitebuilding
*Expand on the HTML, to deliver a more complex experience.*
- Layout
- Forms
- Advanced CSS
- Build a complex webpage (like Wikipedia article)

## First exam
- HTML, CSS
- Basic Sitebuilding
- Understanding the internet

## Module 03 - Introduction Java Basics (Phase 2)
* Become familiar with the typical components of a programming language; setting the foundation for further learning. *
- Turing machine, anatomy of programming; interpreters, compilers
- The components of the Java world - IDE & program, compile to byte code, linking, running in the JVM
- Variables, Data Types
- Arrays - multi-dimensional, jagged
- Expressions
- Control Flow - loops (while, do-while, for), statements (if, if-then, if-then-else, elseif), intro to code blocks
- Strings & StringBuilder
- Simple I/O - the Scanner class (reading from the prompt (System.in), writing to the prompt (System.out))
- Collections - ArrayList, LinkedList
- Functions - parameters, return values, signatures/overloading; main args[], variable scoping
- Mop up/Revisit - Iterators, foreach, data conversion (Autoboxing, unboxing, casting)
- Math Libraries, floor, ceiling, conversion

## Module 04 - Object Orientation
*Understanding how to model the world using Objects; and becoming familiar with the tools and advantages of such.*
- What is OO
- The benefits of OO - theory behind OO, covering encapsulation, data hiding, polymorphism, inheritance
- Intentions/Classes - what is a class and how are they derived, their anatomy (methods, properties, scope); creator; this
- Extensions/Objects - how are they created and used
- Extending OO - sub-classes, super, polymorphism, abstract and interface, boxing/unboxing
- Static, Final, Protected & Private
- Mop up/Revisit - data conversion, Streams, I/O, Scanner in context
  - Date
  - Localisation - decimal point, mm/dd/yy vs dd/mm/yy vs ...


## Module 05 - Consolidating Skills
*Having covered the core concepts at the heart of Java, solidify with practice dojos and gain experience; at the same time, start to understand how to deliver code by testing and handling issues.*
- Exceptions
- Testing (TDD basics) - Karnaugh / Key maps, Assert
- Annotations
- Libraries and Dependency management (Maven, Gradle)
- Project "Todo App" - exercise working through many of the elements learnt thus far

## Module 06 - Approaches - Conventions, Patterns & Frameworks
* Developing and supporting larger applications demands management and commonly understood tools and approaches.*
- Overview of Swing and GUI controls
- Listeners / Events
- *Tiered* architectures - benefits and anatomy
- Patterns & Frameworks - conceptual
- MVC (pattern) and Architecture
- Project/Workshop: RPG using MVC
- Practical: Mapping objects

## Second Exam
- Basics of Programming
- Fundamentals of Java

## Module 07 - Java as a Server
*Continuing on from the previous Module, we look at a Framework.  We also tie together how Java can be used to serve pages and integrate with HTML.*
- Java foundation classes
- Servlets
- Java Server Pages (JSP) - java web basics with templates, integrating with HTML
- Templating (view part; how to display data, HTML generation)
- Mop up/Revisit -  Annotations, Collections, Iterators
- Project/Workshop: Building a Gallery site using JSP

## Module 08 - Working with Data
*How to store and work with data.*
- File I/O - char and binary streams
- Connecting to a database - JDBC (querying, resetting, mechanics)
- SQL Basics - DDL vs DML; select, delete, update statements;
- Alternatives NoSQL, MongoDB
- Object Repository (ORM) - Hibernate framework
- More SQL - keys, normalization;  Stored Procedures & Triggers
- Project/Workshop: Convert Gallery to run using JDBC

## Module 09 - Spring Part 1
*Delve into the Spring Framework to better understand how Java can be used to serve pages while strengthening the understand of JDBC, MVC, annotation, etc.*
- Serialization & marshalling
- xml parsing and xmlpath
- json

## Module 10 - Spring Part 2
- Web container
- MVC
- Generics
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)

## Third Exam
- Java as backend
- Understanding Frameworks
- Persistence

# Team Project (Phase 3)
*Working in teams, deliver specific projects based upon requirements that will be posted later in the semester.*

## Final Exam
- Work and find solutions for problems on your own
- Combination of learnt skills
